How To Correct/Recalculate Chlorophyll Data from raw signal counts in the DAC code:

For a recalculation of Chlorophyll from raw instrument signal counts
according to the manual and calibration certificate for the WETLabs 
ECO Puck FLBBCD:
Edit the chlorophyll section JSON entry in sensor_defs.json for the
deployment you want to recalculate by:
    1. Changing the name of the entry from "sci_flbbcd_chlor" to
    "corrected_chlor"
    2. Adding a "processing" dictionary to the "corrected_chlor" dictionary
    3. Add "dark_offset" and "scale_factor" (ug/L/counts) entries to the
    "processing" dictionary where "dark_offset" and the "scale_factor" entries
    are the "Dark Counts" and "Scale Factor" values found in the ECO Chlorophyll
    Fluoromter Characterization Sheet from the relevant calibration certificate
    for this deployment.

    Here is an example:
        Note: The "comment" entry under "attrs" here has also been added for this
        example, but is not required.
