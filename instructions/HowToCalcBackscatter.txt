How To Process Backscatter Data:

To process Backscatter from the scaled glider output of any WETLabs/Seabird ECO
Puck backscatter instrument (e.g. 'sci_flbbcd_bb_units' where flbbcd is the ECO
letter designations for Chlorophyll(fl), Backscatter(bb), and CDOM(cd)),
inputs for the Centroid Angle of the instrument, the wavelength, and the
Chi-factor parameters are needed. The values are determined from journal
articles and from WETLabs.

See the code from OOI's oceanobservatories Github page:
https://github.com/oceanobservatories/ion-functions/blob/master/ion_functions
/data/flo_functions.py
or the copy of the same code here in the dac code set under
ooidac/processing_dir/fluorometer.py for a description of these parameters.

Alternatively, Backscatter can be processed from the raw instrument counts
(e.g. 'sci_flbbcd_bb_sig') and the calibration parameters "Dark counts" and
"Scale Factor" from the Scattering Meter Calibration Sheet included with the
instrument's recent calibration are additionally required.

First in sensor_defs.json, the code looks for any section that is labeled
"backscatter*".  That is it will repeat the processing for any variant that
has "backscatter" in the variable name (e.g. "backscatter", "backscatter_700",
"backscatter650", etc.). **Remember to change the 'nc_var_name' attribute too.**

A. From scaled output
B. From raw counts

A. To process from scaled output, add the required parameters as inputs to
   the processing code, edit the "backscatter*" section JSON entry in
   sensor_defs.json for the deployment by:
    1. Add a "processing" dictionary to the "backscatter*" dictionary
    2. Add "source_sensor", "wlngth", "theta", and "xfactor" entries to the
    "processing" dictionary.  Where:
        - "source_sensor" is the name of the glider sensor used to process to
        backscatter (e.g. 'sci_flbbcd_bb_units' for a flbbcd instrument)
        - "wlngth" is the wavelength in nanometers (nm),
        - "theta" is the centroid angle in degrees which according to WETLabs
        documentation, 124 degrees is used for the Triplet 3-channel sensors and
        142 degrees is used for the dual channel sensors.
        https://www.seabird.com/asset-get.download.jsa?id=54627861515
        - "xfactor" is the chi-factor and for the 3 channel sensors is 1.076 and
         dual channel sensors is 1.096.
    Note: If all of these input parameters are left out or of the "processing"
    arguments, then it is assumed to be an ECO triplet with 700 nm wavelength.
    If any one or more are left out, it will cause an error, so either
    all or none of these parameters should be included.
    If the "processing" dictionary is left out completely, it is assumed that
    the source sensor to use for processing is 'sci_flbbcd_bb_units'.

    Here is an example for a FLBBCD Chlorophyll, Backscatter, CDOM sensor that
    measures at wavelength 700 nm:

    "backscatter": {
        "attrs": {
            "_FillValue": NaN,
            "accuracy": " ",
            "ancillary_variables": "instrument_flbbcd radiation_wavelength",
            "instrument": "instrument_flbbcd",
            "long_name": "Optical Backscatter (red wavelengths)",
            "OOI_data_product_name": "FLUBSCT",
            "OOI_data_level": "L2a",
            "observation_type": "calculated",
            "platform": "platform",
            "precision": " ",
            "radiation_wavelength": "700nm",
            "resolution": "0.001",
            "standard_name": "volume_backwards_scattering_coefficient_of_radiative_flux_in_sea_water",
            "units": "m-1"
        },
        "dimension": "time",
        "nc_var_name": "backscatter",
        "type": "f8",
        "processing": {
            "source_sensor": "sci_flbbcd_bb_units",
            "wlngth": 700.0,
            "theta": 124.0,
            "xfactor": 1.076
        }
    }, ...


B. To process from raw output, add the required parameters as inputs to
   the processing code, edit the "backscatter*" section JSON entry in
   sensor_defs.json for the deployment by:
    1. Add a "processing" dictionary to the "backscatter*" dictionary
    2. Add "source_sensor", "dark_counts", "scale_factor",entries
       to the "processing" dictionary, where:
        - "source_sensor" is the name of the glider sensor used to process to
        backscatter (e.g. 'sci_flbbcd_bb_units' for a flbbcd instrument)
        - "dark_counts" is the "Dark counts" value from the calibration sheet
        - "scale_factor" is the "Scale Factor" value from the calibration sheet
    3. Optionally add "wlngth", "theta", and "xfactor" to the "processing"
       dictionary.  See section A for the description and typical values.
       Note: If all of the optional input parameters are left out of the
       "processing" arguments, then it is assumed to be an
       ECO triplet with 700 nm wavelength. If any one or more are left out,
       it will cause an error, so either all or none of these optional
       parameters should be included.

    Here is an example for a BB3SLO 3 channel Backscatter sensor that measures
    at wavelengths 470, 532, 650 nm, using the 650 nm for the example.

    "backscatter_650": {
        "attrs": {
            "_FillValue": NaN,
            "accuracy": " ",
            "ancillary_variables": "instrument_flbbcd radiation_wavelength",
            "instrument": "instrument_flbbcd",
            "long_name": "Optical Backscatter (red wavelengths)",
            "OOI_data_product_name": "FLUBSCT",
            "OOI_data_level": "L2a",
            "observation_type": "calculated",
            "platform": "platform",
            "precision": " ",
            "radiation_wavelength": "700nm",
            "resolution": "0.001",
            "standard_name": "volume_backwards_scattering_coefficient_of_radiative_flux_in_sea_water",
            "units": "m-1"
        },
        "dimension": "time",
        "nc_var_name": "backscatter_650",
        "type": "f8",
        "processing": {
            "source_sensor": "sci_bb3slo_b660_sig",
            "dark_counts": 46,
            "scale_factor": 2.131E-6,
            "wlngth": 650.0,
            "theta": 124.0,
            "xfactor": 1.076
        }
    }, ...
