How To Process Backscatter Data from any WETLabs ECO sensor in the DAC code:

To process Backscatter from the glider output 'sci_xxxxx_bb_units',
(where xxxxxx could be any of the ECO letter designations e.g. flbbcd
for Chlorophyll(fl), Backscatter(bb), and CDOM(cd)) inputs for the Centroid
Angle of the instrument, the wavelength, and the Chi-factor parameters are
required.  See the code from OOI's oceanobservatories Github page:
https://github.com/oceanobservatories/ion-functions/blob/master/ion_functions
/data/flo_functions.py
or the copy of the same code here in the dac code set under
ooidac/processing_dir/fluorometer.py for a description of these parameters.

To add these parameters as inputs to the processing code, edit the "backscatter"
section JSON entry in sensor_defs.json for the deployment by:
    1. Add a "processing" dictionary to the "backscatter" dictionary
    2. Add "wlngth", "theta", and "xfactor" entries to the "processing"
    dictionary.  Where:
        - "wlngth" is the wavelength in nanometers (nm),
        - "theta" is the centroid angle in degrees which according to WETLabs
        documentation, 124 degrees is used for the Triplet 3-channel sensors and
        142 degrees is used for the dual channel sensors.

        - "xfactor" is the chi-factor and for the 3 channel sensors is 1.076 and
         dual channel sensors is 1.096.


    Here is an example for a FLBBCD Chlorophyll, Backscatter, CDOM sensor that
    measures at wavelength 700 nm
        Note: The "comment" entry under "attrs" here has also been added for this
        example, but is not required.
