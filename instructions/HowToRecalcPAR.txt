How To Correct/Recalculate PAR Data from the raw sensor volts in the DAC code:

For a recalculation of the PAR values from the raw sensor volts in the 
m_bsipar_sensor_volts sensor:
Edit the JSON entry for PAR in sensor_defs.json for that deployment by:
    1. Changing the section entry name from "sci_bsipar_par" to "corrected_par"
    2. Adding a "processing" arguments dictionary to the section top level
    3. Adding "sensor_dark" and "scale_factor" entries to the "processing"
       arguments where:
        - "scale_factor" is the Wet value (uE/m^2sec) in the Calibration
          Scale Factor section from the relevant calibration certificate
          for this deployment.
        - "sensor_dark" is the Sensor Dark value under the Sensor Output Voltage
          section from the relevant calibration certificate converted from
          mVolts to Volts.

    Here is an example:
        Note: The "comment" entry in "attrs" has also been added, but is not
        required.
