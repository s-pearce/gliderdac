How To Correct/Recalculate Oxygen Data from Calphase in the DAC code:

To recalculate oxygen from the calibrated phase measurement from an Aanderaa
4832 optode, edit the JSON entry in sensor_defs.json for that deployment by:
    1. Changing the name of the entry from "oxygen" to
    "corrected_oxygen"
    2. Adding a "processing" dictionary to the top level of the
    "corrected_oxygen" dictionary
    3. Add a "calculation_type" entry to the "attrs" dictionary.  This must
    be either "MkII" or "SVU".  This is added to the 'attrs' so that it is kept
    in the netCDF variable attributes of the final product for traceability.
    4. Add the relevant calibration inputs for the calculation type used to
    recalculate oxygen from calphase.

For the specific cases, see the further instruction and example cases below.
A. MkII calculation (Not multipoint calibrated optodes)
B. SVU calculation (Multipoint calibrated optodes)


A. For a recalculation using the MkII calculation (previous to using the
    SVU calculation):

    The "processing" dictionary is required to have entries "C",
    "FoilPolyDegT", "FoilPolyDegO", and "ConcCoef".  These entries should have
    the calibration coefficients values from the appropriate Calibration
    Certificate document that is relevant for this deployment.
    Where:
        - "C" are the values "FoilCoefA" and "FoilCoefB" concatenated together
         into one list.
        - "FoilPolyDegT" and "FoilPolyDegO" are the power coefficients for
         temperature and calphase respectively.
        - ConcCoef are the calibration adjustment values.
        - Note that "FoilCoefA", "FoilCoefB", "FoilPolyDegT", and "FoilPolyDegO"
         are values associated with the foil ID, rather than the specific optode
         and calibration whereas "ConcCoef" is a value specifically associated
         with the optode and calibration.  This might mean the values are found
         on different documents, but they can all be found in the optode's
         internal configuration printout.

    Here is an example:
        Note: The "comment" entry under "attrs" here has also been added for this
        example, but is not required.

        "attrs": {

            }
        }
    },



B. For recalculation using the SVU calculation:

    The "processing" dictionary is required to have entries "SVUFoilCoef"
    and "ConcCoef", where "SVUFoilCoef" are the Sterm-Volmer-Uchida calibration
    coefficients and "ConcCoef" are the Concentration adjustment Coefficient
    values for adjusting a calibration.  Both of these are found in the
    calibration certificate or from the optode's configuration.

    Here is an example:
        Note: The "comment" entry under "attrs" here has also been added for this
        example, but is not required.

Edit the JSON entry in sensor_defs.json for that deployment to look like:
    "corrected_oxygen": {
        "attrs": {
            "_FillValue": NaN,
            "accuracy": "instrument_oxygen",
            "ancillary_variables": " ",
