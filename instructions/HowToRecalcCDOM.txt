How To Correct/Recalculate CDOM Data from raw signal counts in the DAC code:

For a recalculation of CDOM from raw instrument signal counts according to the
manual and calibration certificate for the WETLabs ECO Puck FLBBCD follow these
steps.

Edit the CDOM section JSON entry in sensor_defs.json for the deployment you 
want to recalculate by:
    1. Changing the name of the entry from "sci_flbbcd_cdom_units" to
    "corrected_cdom"
    2. Adding a "processing" dictionary to the "corrected_cdom" dictionary (not
    under "attrs"). In this example it is inserted after the "type" entry at 
    the bottom.
    3. Add "dark_offset" and "scale_factor" (ug/L/counts) entries to the
    "processing" dictionary where "dark_offset" and the "scale_factor" entries
    are the "Dark Counts" and "Scale Factor" calibration values found in the 
    ECO CDOM Fluorometer Characterization Sheet from the relevant calibration 
    certificate for this instrument-deployment combination.

    Here is an example:
        Note: The "comment" entry under "attrs" here has also been added for this
        example, but is not required.
